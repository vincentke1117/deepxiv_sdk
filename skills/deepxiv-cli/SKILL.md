## 📚 Core Commands Reference

### 0. Ask a Question (`deepxiv ask`)

**When to use**: The goal is an *answer*, not a specific paper's text. This runs
the whole search → judge → read loop server-side and returns prose with real
citations. Reach for it before hand-rolling `search` + `paper --section`.

```bash
# arXiv (default) — methods, numbers, experimental results
deepxiv ask "what speedup does speculative decoding report on HumanEval"
deepxiv ask "对比几种缓解 MoE 路由崩塌的方法" --effort high

# --web — current events, products, pricing, anything non-academic
deepxiv ask "Anthropic Claude API pricing tiers" --web
deepxiv ask "NeurIPS 2025 best paper winner" --web --search-type news
deepxiv ask "retrieval evaluation methodology" --web --search-type scholar
```

**Requires a registered key.** The auto-registered SDK token returns `403` —
users must register at https://data.rag.ac.cn/register. Every account gets 30
agentic calls/day free, from a quota pool separate from the general daily limit
(so a `429` here does not block `search` or `paper`). If a call 403s, tell the
user to register rather than retrying.

Takes 8–30s end to end; the answer streams, so text appears well before that.

| `--effort` | Rounds | First token (arXiv / web) | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | 1–2 | 3–4s / 5–9s | Facts, finding papers, one specific number |
| `high` | 3 | 7–8s / ≈13s | Comparing sources, needing body-text detail |
| `xhigh` | 4–5 | 9–13s / longer | How a direction evolved, cross-source surveys |

**Writing the query — this matters more than any flag:**
- Be specific. `"what compression ratio does KV cache eviction report on LongBench"`
  works; `"kv cache"` does not.
- Ask for numbers explicitly ("what speedup", "which benchmark") to make it read
  paper bodies rather than abstracts.
- Put scope in the query text: year, venue, category, author, min citations.
- Chinese queries work directly; the answer comes back in the query's language.
- **If the answer misses, rephrase — don't just raise `--effort`.** Effort adds
  reading rounds but cannot redirect first-round recall.

**Reading the output:**
- Answer → stdout; sources and progress → stderr. `deepxiv ask "..." > answer.md`
  captures only the answer.
- Every `[arXiv:ID]` is real — the service is instructed never to invent one, and
  says "no relevant papers" instead of fabricating. Keep those IDs in what you
  report back to the user.
- The sources list is the *retrieval set*, a superset of what's cited. The CLI
  shows only cited sources; `--all-sources` shows the rest.
- **On `--web`, weigh evidence strength.** The service reads only *cached* page
  bodies and never fetches live, so uncached pages contribute just a search
  snippet. The CLI marks pages read in full (📄) versus snippet-only (🔗), and
  the answer flags snippet-only claims. Pass that caveat on to the user instead
  of presenting everything as equally solid.
- On a truncation warning, do not treat the answer as complete — re-run with a
  larger `--max-answer-tokens` or a narrower query.
- Follow up on any cited paper with the normal commands:
  `deepxiv paper <id> --section Method`.

### 1. Search Papers (`deepxiv search`)

**When to use**: Finding relevant papers on a topic

```bash
# Basic search (quick)
deepxiv search "agent memory" --limit 5

# Advanced search with filters
deepxiv search "transformer" --format json
deepxiv search "LLM" --categories cs.AI,cs.CL --min-citations 100

# Date range
deepxiv search "vision models" --date-from 2024-01-01 --date-to 2024-12-31
```

**Expected output**: List of papers with title, arxiv_id, score, citation count
**Token cost**: ≈500-1000 tokens per search
**Tips**:
- Use `--limit 3-5` for quick overview
- Use `--format json` for downstream processing
- Add `--use-fine-rerank` when ranking quality matters more than latency

---

### 2. Read arXiv Papers (`deepxiv paper`)

**When to use**: Understanding specific papers (choose format by depth needed)

#### Option A: Quick Summary (30 seconds)
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --brief
# ✓ Best for: Quick understanding
# → Title, TLDR, keywords, citation count
# Token cost: ~500 tokens
# Use when: "What's this paper about?"
```

#### Option B: Paper Structure (2 minutes)
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --head
# ✓ Best for: Understanding paper organization
# → Metadata, all sections with summaries
# Token cost: ~1-2k tokens
# Use when: "What does this paper contain?"
```

#### Option C: Quick Scan (3 minutes)
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --preview
# ✓ Best for: Fast preview without full read
# → First ~10k characters
# Token cost: ~2k tokens
# Use when: "Let me scan the introduction"
```

#### Option D: Specific Section (1 minute)
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --section Introduction
# ✓ Best for: Reading one section in detail
# → Full section content
# Token cost: ~1-5k tokens (varies by section)
# Use when: "I only need the introduction"
```

#### Option E: Complete Paper (for deep analysis)
```bash
deepxiv paper 2409.05591
# or explicitly: deepxiv paper 2409.05591 --raw
# ✓ Best for: Full text analysis
# → Complete paper in markdown
# Token cost: ~10-50k tokens
# Use when: "I need to thoroughly analyze this"
```

---

### 3. Access Biomedical Literature (`deepxiv pmc`)

**When to use**: Need medical, biology, or biomedical research

```bash
# Quick metadata
deepxiv pmc PMC544940 --head

# Full paper
deepxiv pmc PMC544940
```

**Expected output**: Paper metadata or complete paper JSON
**Token cost**: ≈1-2k tokens (metadata), ≈10-30k tokens (full)

---

### 4. Manage Token (`deepxiv token`)

**When to use**: Check your API token status

```bash
deepxiv token
# Shows current token and daily limit info
```

**Note**: Token auto-registers on first use, saves to `~/.env`

---

### 5. Find Researchers (`deepxiv talent`) — beta

**Availability**: ships in `1.1.0b1`, source install only (`pip install git+https://github.com/DeepXiv/deepxiv_sdk.git`). The talent index is still being built out, so coverage is uneven — a search that returns thin or irrelevant people is a data gap, not a bad query.

**When to use**: You need people, not papers — who works on a topic, and what is their record

```bash
# Semantic search: describe the person you want in a sentence
deepxiv talent search "young faculty working on retrieval-augmented generation" --semantic --limit 5

# Keyword mode: matches names and affiliations
deepxiv talent search "Zhicheng Dou"

# Filter and sort
deepxiv talent search --tags LLM,Agent --career-stage student --sort total_citations --limit 10

# Full profile by ID (IDs come from search)
deepxiv talent survey 257                    # text summary
deepxiv talent survey 257 --format markdown  # the generated report
deepxiv talent survey 257 --no-refresh       # read-only, no Scholar refresh
deepxiv talent survey 257 --json             # raw JSON
```

**Output**: search gives id, names, affiliation, h-index, citations, tags.
survey adds bio, education, work history, links, open-source projects, and
publication metrics.

**Quota**: 1 agentic call each — the same pool as `deepxiv ask` (free 30/day).
Requires a registered key. Profiles older than ~14 days refresh from Google
Scholar automatically on `survey`; use `--no-refresh` to avoid that.

---

### 6. Intelligent Agent (`deepxiv agent`)

**When to use**: Need analysis beyond simple retrieval

```bash
# One-time query
deepxiv agent query "What are key innovations in this paper?"

# Multi-turn reasoning
deepxiv agent query "Compare these two approaches" --max-turn 10 --verbose

# First time setup
deepxiv agent config
# Configure your LLM (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, etc.)
```

**Token cost**: Varies by reasoning depth
**Requirements**: Requires langgraph and langchain-core

---

## ✨ Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start with `--brief`** - Always start with brief overview
2. **Use sections** - Don't load full papers when sections suffice
3. **Save tokens** - Stack operations to reduce API calls
4. **Check limits** - Run `deepxiv token` before large batches
5. **Use agent wisely** - For complex analysis that needs reasoning
6. **Format choice** - Use `--format json` for piping, plain text for humans
7. **Error handling** - Always handle "Paper not found" and "Limit exceeded" cases
